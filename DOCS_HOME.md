Welcome
=======

Welcome to the Zen C++ libraries. The Zen C++ libraries strive to be
well-tested and modern support libraries for serious C++ programming.
Zen++ draws many ideas from other programming languages, most notably
[Rust][1] and [Haskell][2].

The sources of the libraries are freely available on [GitHub][3]. Anyone is
welcome to contribute his or her code to the libraries, as long as you remain
respectful and understand that not all code gets automatically accepted.

## Getting Started

You can embed this project in any tool that accepts CMake or Meson build files.
Just download a copy of the latest source from [the repository][3] and add the
project as a dependency to your current project.

### Basic Infrastructure

The following pages explain how to write code that uses the basic facilities of
Zen+++.

### Advanced Use-cases

If you want to create your own library on top of Zen++, the following pages are
for you.
